Algorithms Problem
Build a binary search tree in any language of your choice.
    The tree should support the following operations:
        Inserting an integer into the tree
        Finding if a given integer is present in the tree
        Deleting an integer from the tree
The code must have the following characteristics (basically, pretend you are writing it in clojure or haskell)
    The tree must be immutable
    The tree must be thread safe (two threads can modify the tree simultaneously)
    All functions in the code must have a single exit point
    Pay attention to memory usage
    We expect good unit tests
Extra credit:
    The tree must be self balancing
    Use your tree to find the count of the words in a huge text file.
